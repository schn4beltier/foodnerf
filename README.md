# Nerfed Food

This mod can change the value of nutrition and saturation food items restore.

By default it just halves the effectivity of Vanilla-Foods, like Pam's Harvest Craft used to do.
Food items introduced by other mods can be included in the config file.



Feel free to use this in your modpack or fork it or do whatever you want with it.
